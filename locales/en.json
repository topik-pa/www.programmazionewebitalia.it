SEO offers numerous benefits, making it an essential component of any digital marketing strategy.

It is estimated that <em>about 15 percent of the world's population lives with some form of disability</em>. With this in mind, making the site accessible broadens the potential user base. Many of the principles of accessibility, such as proper use of alternative text for images, optimization of titles, and clear page structure, also <em>help search engines</em> better understand the site's content. In addition, <em>an accessible site tends to be easier to use</em> for everyone, not just people with disabilities.",

		"more-title-2": "How to optimize the Accessibility of a Web site?",
		"more-text-2": "Optimizing the accessibility of a website requires a series of actions that improve the browsing experience for all users, including those with disabilities. The guidelines mainly suggest that: <em>text and graphic</em> elements should be easily readable for all users, including those with visual impairments or color blindness; the site should be <em>fully navigable using only the keyboard</em>, since some people cannot use a mouse; <em>forms should be accessible</em> and clear; you need to make sure that the <em>user interface is consistent</em> throughout the site... More generally, a <em>clear and predictable design</em> helps people with cognitive disabilities navigate more easily.",
		"more-title-3": "What are the 4 principles of Accessibility?",
		"more-text-3": "Web accessibility is based on four basic principles established by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). To be accessible, a site must be <em>perceptible</em>: information and user interface components must be presented in a way that users can perceive them (contrasts, alternative text...). A site must be <em>usable</em>: interface components and navigation must be easily usable by all users (navigability via keyboard or alternative devices to the mouse). The third principle refers to <em>comprehension</em>: the information and operation of the user interface must be understandable (clear text, unambiguous error messages...). Finally, the last principle relates to <em>robustness</em>: content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide range of user agents, including assistive devices (semantically valid and well-structured HTML and CSS)."
